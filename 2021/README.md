# 2021 Advent of Code

* Day 1: Sonar Sweep - Fun! Surprisingly simple. I guess we'll see how it ramps up.
* Day 2: Dive! - Also _quite_ straightforward. Wish I'd started sooner; got this one real fast.
* Day 3: Binary Diagnostic - Okay, now we're talking. Did the first part using bit shifting and masking, which I'm proud of. But that turned out to be awkward for part 2, so I floundered until I switched to using substrings.
* Day 4: Giant Squid (Bingo) - Oof, just getting the input was tough here. The first part was pretty straightforward, though it didn't occur to me that you could just zero out the "picked" numbers since you don't need them later. That would have cleaned up my code a lot.
* Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture - This one was pretty straightforward as well. Took me a second to figure out how to get the list of points for a diagonal line, but fortunately my part 1 didn't need to be modified at all -- it Just Worked once I got that added.
* Day 6: Lanternfish - Part 1 was fairly easy. Then part 2 was taking forever. I waiting way too long on it before it occurred to me that there was a better way. Writing and running the better way took just a few minutes, once I thought to do it!
* Day 7: The Treachery of Whales (best fit w/cost) - Something about the wording of this problem made me worried that it'd be a dynamic programming problem, but then it ended up being really straightforward! Nice break from the weekend.
