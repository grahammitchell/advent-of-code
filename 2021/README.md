# 2021 Advent of Code

* Day 1: Sonar Sweep - Fun! Surprisingly simple. I guess we'll see how it ramps up.
* Day 2: Dive! - Also _quite_ straightforward. Wish I'd started sooner; got this one real fast.
* Day 3: Binary Diagnostic - Okay, now we're talking. Did the first part using bit shifting and masking, which I'm proud of. But that turned out to be awkward for part 2, so I floundered until I switched to using substrings.
* Day 4: Giant Squid (Bingo) - Oof, just getting the input was tough here. The first part was pretty straightforward, though it didn't occur to me that you could just zero out the "picked" numbers since you don't need them later. That would have cleaned up my code a lot.
* Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture - This one was pretty straightforward as well. Took me a second to figure out how to get the list of points for a diagonal line, but fortunately my part 1 didn't need to be modified at all -- it Just Worked once I got that added.
* Day 6: Lanternfish - Part 1 was fairly easy. Then part 2 was taking forever. I waiting way too long on it before it occurred to me that there was a better way. Writing and running the better way took just a few minutes, once I thought to do it!
* Day 7: The Treachery of Whales (best fit w/cost) - Something about the wording of this problem made me worried that it'd be a dynamic programming problem, but then it ended up being really straightforward! Nice break from the weekend.
* Day 8: Seven Segment Search - GOODNESS GRACIOUS, this hurt my brain. I'm pleased to say that although it took me over an hour to figure out what to write, my code gave the correct answer the first time.
* Day 9: Smoke Basin - Part 1 was straightforward. Didn't do part 2 yet because I still never properly learned BFS and have to reinvent it from first principles every time and I'm too sleepy. I'll come back to it at some point.
* Day 10: Syntax Scoring - Ah, good old stack-based brace matching. Relatively easy except for the weird scoring.
* Day 11: Dumbo Octopus - I probably over-engineered this trying to make sure they could only flash once. But the benefit was that part 2 was a trivial modification.
* Day 12: Passage Pathing - Oof, graphs. These weren't taught when I was in school and I never bothered to learn them after since they don't come up in my line of work. Google to the rescue! I'm actually just proud that I eventually got this one working.
* Day 13: Transparent Origami - Never been good at visualizing things in 2D, but fortunately I'm good at algebra so I was just able to keep them as an array of points for most of the program. Neat ending, though.
